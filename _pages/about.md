I am Director of Data Sciences for the [University of Pennsylvania Program on Opinion Research and Election Studies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fpores.upenn.edu%2F&sa=D) and a Senior Election Analyst for NBC News. I received my PhD in Political Science at Vanderbilt University. My research focuses on elections, polling, and political communication.

At Penn I teach introductory courses in data science and statistics as part of the Survey Research and Data Analytics minor and the College of Arts and Science Data Science minor. 

At NBC News I work on the Decision Desk team building models of electoral outcomes, assisting in survey weighting and poll design, and making race calls on election nights.

My academic work has appeared in the Journal of Politics, Science Advances, Public Opinion Quarterly, the British Journal of Political Science, Legislative Studies Quarterly, Political Behavior, and the International Journal of Press/Politics.
