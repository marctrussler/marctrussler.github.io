excerpt: 'Merging together data on the roll-out of broadband, legislative elections, candidate characteristics, and individual voters, I show that voters in high-information environments are less likely to make voting decisions for members of Congress that reward good behavior or punish bad behavior. Voters under these conditions cast more straight tickets, produce a smaller incumbency advantage, and are unresponsive to changes in their legislator`s party-line voting.'

How does the changing information environment affect the degree to which voters make independent decisions for different offices on their ballots? Leveraging the gradual roll-out of broadband internet across the United States and across congressional districts, this study uses within-district variation over four election cycles to examine the effects of internet access on voting behavior in US legislative elections. The results show that the expansion of broadband resulted in less split-ticket voting and a lower incumbency advantage because voters exposed to increased high-speed internet voted in a more partisan fashion. Consistent with work demonstrating the effect of the internet on local news consumption, the results suggest that the change in the information environment resulting from enhanced internet access led voters to prioritize national considerations over local considerations. This has important consequences for not only how voters act, but the resulting incentives that elected officials confront.
